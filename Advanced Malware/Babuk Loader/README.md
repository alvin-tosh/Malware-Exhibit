Babuk, also known internally as Babyk, initially “Vasa Locker,” is a pretty new ransomware threat discovered at the beginning of 2021. The gang, defining itself as a non-malicious group created to reveal the security issues inside the corporate networks, is responsible for attacks on at least five big enterprises.

According to security researchers, Babuk Locker’s coding is amateurish but includes secure encryption that prevents victims from recovering their files for free.

In April 2021, the group threatened Washington D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department (M.P.D.) to release sensitive information pulled from the department’s systems and demanded a $4 million ransom. Babuk’s cybercriminals declared they had downloaded 250 GigaBytes of data and threatened to release information about police informants to criminal gangs and to continue attacking the state sectors, including the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The ransomware gang does not have a stable internal structure. The group claimed to get retired after attacking the Metropolitan Police Department and feeling the heat from U.S. law enforcement. However, one month later, some group members splintered off to relaunch the ransomware as Babuk V2 and declared that they would quit ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) crypto locking and focus on data-theft extortion. 

In July 2021, RAMP, the forum started by Babuk, has seen a surge of flooding and spamming with pornographic GIFs. An unknown individual stated they had 24 hours to pay $5,000, and this situation was called “ransomware group drama” at cybersecurity news. 

Finally, one of the developers for the Babuk ransomware group, a 17-year-old person from Russia, leaked the entire Babuk source code for Windows, ESXI, and NAS in September. It is wondered what is going to be the next step of the gang.

## Target for Babuk?

The group generally targets the transportation, healthcare, plastic surgery, electronics, and agricultural sectors across multiple geographies, especially in Germany, Hong Kong, Sweden, and the United States. Anecdotal data also suggests that malware samples have appeared in other Asian, European, and North American countries, even though this may be a consequence of increased security researcher activity rather than active compromises.

On the other hand, they are pretty clear about categories of organizations they do not attack. The gang claims that it does not audit the hospitals except private plastic surgery or dental clinics, any non-profitable charitable foundation, schools except significant universities, and small businesses with annual revenue of less than $4 million.
