Android spyware used by APT-C-23, a threat group also known as Two-tailed Scorpion and mainly targeting the Middle East (Israel and allies). ESET products detect the malware as Android/SpyC23.A.

The APT-C-23 group is known to have used both Windows and Android components in its operations, with the Android components first described in 2017. In the same year, multiple analyses of APT-C-23’s mobile malware were published.
Compared to the versions documented in 2017, Android/SpyC23.A has extended spying functionality, including reading notifications from messaging apps, call recording and screen recording, and new stealth features, such as dismissing notifications from built-in Android security apps. One of the ways the spyware is distributed is via a fake Android app store, using well-known apps as a lure. In April 2020, @malwrhunterteam tweeted about a new Android malware sample. According to the VirusTotal service, no security vendor besides ESET detected the sample at the time. In cooperation with @malwrhunterteam, we recognized the malware to be part of the APT-C-23 arsenal.
