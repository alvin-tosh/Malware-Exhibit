Few things to NOTE 📝👇
1. Dont deploy on your personal machine. These stuff can go on to infect other devices in your network.
2. If there is a password on the ZIP(coz VX-UNDERGROUND)....the password is 'infected'.....without the quotes....offcourse🤭
3. Some are .ex_ intead of .exe to avoid accidental deployment by double clicking
