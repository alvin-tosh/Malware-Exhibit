From Backdoors, bruteforce, Defacement payloads, Spyware ---
To Mphak and Massma malware families....All here!!

If the zip requests a password...
  type 'infected'.....without the quotation marks, Offcourse... 
  
These:

    👉 Randomly collected in the wild,
    👉 Shared by victims or other malware researchers (vx-underground + Mandiant + crowdstrike)
    👉 A lot coded by me
    👉 A lot retrieved by triaging
    👉 crewcorp is reverse engineered. The rest is barely obfuscated.
    
    Careful yo!😋
