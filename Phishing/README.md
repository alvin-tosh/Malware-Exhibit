    These are exact replicas of real world platforms. Why...? Well, If you wish to get the Google credentials of a target, this is your best option. A replica of a google login page can be sent to the target and when they try to login with their legit google credentials...BAM! You got them. Dont do that though unless for educational purposes and with explicit permission from the target.
