# Win32 Malware

    The Windows API (WinAPI); 
    is Microsoft's core set of application programming interfaces available in the Microsoft Windows operating systems. 
    The name Windows API collectively refers to several different platform implementations that are often referred to by their own names.
    It allows user-written programs to interact with Windows, for example to display things on screen and get input from mouse and keyboard. 
    All Windows  programs except console programs must interact with the Windows API regardless of the language. 
    Win32.exe is located in the C:\Windows\System32 folder. 
    A Win32 error is a standard computer error that occurs mainly on computers using Windows versions 95, 98 and 2000 and often during Internet usage. 
    When your computer gets a Win32 error, the application that the error occurred in ceases to work and you are unable to use the function on your computer.
